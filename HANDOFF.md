## Last Session — stage 5.4 part 1 (v1.5.0)

**Backdrop assignment and session persistence**, plus three scroll defects found by driving the
site with Playwright. Full narrative in `WORKLOG.md` v1.5.0; the v1.4.1 narrative it replaces is
already there.

Carried forward as the things most likely to be got wrong next:

- **`Turn` is not JSON-safe, and looked like it was.** `EventMix.counts` is a `Map`, and
  `JSON.stringify` writes a `Map` as `{}` — no error, no warning, nothing failing until a resumed
  turn reached the inspector and called `.get` on a plain object. The suite was green; the page
  was broken. **Persistence recomputes `mix` rather than storing it**, and the general form is
  worth holding onto: *derived state must not be persisted*, and a `Map` or `Set` anywhere in a
  persisted type is a silent data-loss bug waiting for a reload.
- **The v1.4.1 lesson recurred twice in one session, both times in the same shape.** The 5.3
  backdrop stub always returned *a* backdrop, so a dead branch and a mis-assigned room were both
  invisible; `scrollIntoView` always scrolled, so a 9.6px shortfall was invisible. **A total
  function with a wrong answer is the failure mode this codebase keeps producing** — assert the
  answer, never that an answer happened.
- **Everything real this session was found by looking at the running page**, not by tests. Three
  scroll defects, one dead backdrop branch, one `Map` round-trip. Keep Playwright in the loop.
- **Backdrop scarcity was mis-scoped as 5.4's constraint** and is 5.5's; see Open Issues. The
  general point: *the exit criterion bounds the constraint*. "Opening area playable" needs 13
  rooms, not 110, and nobody had counted.
- **Resume replays turns, it does not re-execute them.** `SaveState` stays the only source of
  world truth; the replayed turns are rendering. If a future change makes `play()` mutate engine
  state, resume silently double-applies it.

Carried forward as the things most likely to be got wrong next:

- **`art/`'s corpus sweep asserts shape, not colour** — non-empty, inside the canvas — and an
  inversion satisfies both *perfectly*. That is how this reached a released build. The general
  form: **the right shape is what makes a colour bug invisible**, which is gotcha 3 in
  `docs/AVB_FORMAT.md` one level down. **Anything in 5.4 that makes a new colour or polarity
  decision — backdrops, balloons, page furniture — needs its own pinning assertion**, because
  no existing test will notice.
- **`art/test/polarity.test.ts` pins the pixel-code → colour mapping, not the art.** Its first
  draft asserted *ink is a minority of drawn area*; anna's bob is a legitimate 80% ink and
  falsified it. **Art statistics are not invariants.** Keep the assertion on the code table —
  and note the near miss: trusting the ratio would have "fixed" a correct character.
- **Verify a regression test by reverting the fix**, not by watching it pass. Done here for all
  three assertions. A test written *from* a known bug passes trivially on the fixed code.
- **The type-only import line still holds.** Naming the manifest types from a module that
  imports the decoder put `node:zlib` in the browser program; hence the types-only leaf
  `art/src/cast-manifest.ts`. **If `web/dist/art/src/` ever holds more than `format.js`,
  `pose.js` and `cast-manifest.js`, that line has been crossed.**
- **The join is implemented twice on purpose** — pixels in `art/src/composite.ts`, sheet
  sub-rects in `web/src/comic/figure.ts` — because merging them drags the decoder into the
  browser. `web/test/figure.test.ts` runs both over the real cast pose for pose; that test is the
  only thing making the duplication acceptable, so do not weaken it.
- **Resize re-renders, never rescales**, and the pose round-robin is frozen per panel. Balloon
  breaks are a function of panel width (§4a), and an unfrozen cycle would redraw the whole strip
  with different bodies whenever the window moved.
- **The mapper is pure and canvas-free; the renderer holds all the numbers.** The mapper decides
  *what shot this is*, `render.ts` decides what that looks like at the current width. Keep that
  split — it is what lets 11 walkthroughs replay through the mapping in Node.
- **`SHOTS` in `render.ts` is authoring judgement sitting on top of the ADR**, not part of it.
  The ADR fixes which rung fires; those fill/reveal/backdrop numbers are the first values that
  made each rung legible and are the obvious thing to tune when the comic is *looked at*.
- **The mapper independently reproduced ADR 0004's own measurements** (medium 49.5% ·
  establishing 30.5% · close-up 12.0% · reaction 5.5% · wide 2.5%, against the ADR's 52.4 / 26.5 /
  12.7 / 5.8 / 2.6). Treat that as evidence the tables describe the event stream — and still
  assert orderings, never percentages.

Also fixed: `web/tools/serve.ts` printed a raw unhandled `'error'` stack on `EADDRINUSE`,
*after* a successful build — it read as a broken shell rather than a port held by a previous
`dev`. It now names the port and offers `PORT=`.

## Next Actions (per `docs/DEVELOPMENT_PLAN.md`)

**M4: 4.1–4.7 ✅. M5: 5.1 ✅, 5.2 ✅, 5.3 ✅ (⚑ Gate D cleared). 5.4 in progress** — **backdrop
assignment ✅** and **persistence ✅** (v1.5.0). **Panel sequencing** and **portraits** are open and
unblocked; **narration styling is blocked on a contract question**, below.

0. **Narration styling needs a decision before it needs code.** The transcript renders room name
   and room description as one undifferentiated `prose` block, because **`room-title` never
   arrives**: `NarrationChannel` declares `room-title | prose | system`, `builtins.ts:440` emits
   the title on its own channel, but that engine-side `describeRoom` is not what runs — Zork's own
   `DESCRIBE-ROOM` from the world document does, and it prints the name inside a `prose` line.
   **`.line.room-title` in `style.css` is therefore dead CSS**, exactly as the `field` backdrop was
   dead code, and `web/src/status.ts` already documents the workaround it forced.
   The shell cannot fix this alone: styling by parsing narration is what ADR 0002 exists to
   prevent, and there is no regex over narration anywhere in the pane today. **So it is an engine
   change** — make the ZIL `DESCRIBE-ROOM` path emit `room-title` — **and the risk is parity**:
   splitting one narration event into two changes the event stream that 143/143 strict turns are
   measured against. Check whether the harness compares events or concatenated text before
   estimating this. **Recommendation: do it, and do it before more panes depend on the workaround**
   — `system` is unemitted for the same reason and will need the same fix.

1. **Stage 5.4 — presentation buildout: panel sequencing, portraits, narration styling,
   persistence.** Exit criterion is the opening area playable in comic form. What is left and what
   5.3 leaves it:
   - **Done at v1.5.0:** room→backdrop assignment (`web/src/comic/backdrop.ts`, a table, not a
     regex) and session persistence (`web/src/persistence.ts`, autosave + resume by replaying
     `Turn[]` through `play()`).
   - **Still open:** panel sequencing, character portraits, narration styling (item 0).
   - **The mapper and the renderer are the seam.** Add framing and sequencing in `render.ts` and
     `comic-view.ts`; changing what a *shot means* is a `mapper.ts` change and an ADR question.
   - **Two authoring items 5.3 stubbed are still stubs**, each marked at its call site: the
     **Guide's identity and voice** (`GUIDE_SCRIPT` in `comic-view.ts` is six placeholder lines
     proving the mechanism, plus a cooldown the ADR deliberately does not set) and **`SHOTS`** in
     `render.ts`. The third, **room → backdrop**, is resolved (v1.5.0).
   - **Page composition and PDF export are §5**, and deliberately not WYSIWYG: once panel width is
     a function of the viewport, a WYSIWYG export would have to pick one reader's window to be
     canonical. Expect that to read as a bug to someone; it is the decision.

2. **`V-CLIMB-UP`, the last stub** — stalls on `GETPT`. Recorded as a known limitation at Gate C
   because no walkthrough diverges on it, but it is the last known gap in Group A coverage and
   the natural companion to the `OTHER-SIDE` item below, which needs the same idiom.

3. **Unassigned one-off tail** in the routine catalog: `<NEXTP …>` (OTHER-SIDE — ADR 0003
   rewrote `I-SWORD`'s scan but does **not** cover OTHER-SIDE, which needs the direction number
   and a door match), `<NTH …>` (I-CYCLOPS — a table index, not an exit scan, despite having
   been grouped with `I-SWORD`), String-in-statement-position (GRATE-FUNCTION), bare
   `,ONBIT`/`,ACTORBIT` (LIT?, V-SAY), non-atom FSET? flag (GOTO), `REST` with a non-literal
   byte count (PICK-ONE — Group A regardless).

4. **The invisible-routine audit, re-run after ADR 0003.** 439 ROUTINE forms, **360 extracted,
   28 catalogued, 51 invisible**. 45 are correctly excluded by design (40 `gparser`, 3 `gclock`,
   2 `gmain`: the engine owns the parser, the clock and the turn loop). The tail worth triage is
   now six: `BREATHE`, `MIN`, `UNTIE-FROM`, `FIND-IN`, `NO-GO-TELL`, `YES?` — `INFESTED?` left
   the list by being reached, which is precisely the point below.
   **Worth making this a standing report rather than a one-off**: the catalog names the routine
   that failed but never what its failure cost, which is exactly why combat stayed hidden for
   two milestones.

5. **Panel grammar ✅ — `docs/adr/0004-presentation-mapping.md` is Accepted**, and amended twice
   at 5.3 from implementation evidence. The ADR is the decision of record; **amend the ADR, not
   the discussion doc.** What is left is authoring judgement, and the user has asked for a
   **recommendation at the point each is needed — lead with a pick, not a survey**. Settled at
   5.3: **casting (Hero = dan, Guide = tiki)** and **pull-quote selection** (the caption quotes
   the sentence the affect marker matched, else the turn's first; an over-long one is dropped
   rather than trimmed, since trimming makes it a paraphrase by omission). Still open: the
   **Guide's identity and voice**, its **trigger rate** (the mechanism ships, the rate is
   deliberately unset by the ADR), **page composition**, **§4a breakpoints**, **PDF byte size**,
   **pane scroll coupling**, and the **`SHOTS` framing table**.

6. **Assisted input — designed, deferred to after the MVP.** A SCUMM-style command picker; see
   discussion §15. Not to be started before the MVP ships, but two constraints should be
   remembered whenever it comes up: **Zork's 135-verb list is a spoiler table** (`ECHO`,
   `ODYSSEUS`, `PRAY` *are* puzzle solutions, unlike Monkey Island's mundane nine), so it needs a
   fixed core verb set with puzzle verbs typed-only; and it **structurally removes `parser-miss`**,
   the largest affect marker at 12.7%, so it flattens the comic unless something replaces it. It
   requires an **ADR 0002 amendment** — a read-only query API (`objectsInScope()`), pull not push,
   leaving the event stream at 1.0.0. `engine/src/scope.ts` already computes the answer.

**Standing method note: measure before proposing rules.** Five plausible proposals died that way
across the panel-grammar sessions. The harness replay and the `art/` corpus both answer questions
cheaply, and a measurement taken for one question often answers another — the 0-`speech` census
sat unread for two sessions before it settled the balloon class.

## Open Issues

**Engine / IR**
- **ZIL property defaults live in the engine, not the IR.** `PROPDEF SIZE 5` etc. are encoded in
  `engine/src/interpreter.ts`; the document is the correct home, and a `propdefs` section is
  deferred rather than rejected. **Do not "simplify" this to a blanket 0 default** — tried in
  v0.6.6, breaks ten of eleven walkthroughs, because `truthy()` counts 0 as true and the `false`
  sentinel distinguishes absent from zero. The table also carries `strength`, a Zork property
  rather than a library one — the ADR 0002 seam this table already sits on.
- **`Room.adjacent` is derived data in a document that otherwise transcribes the source**
  (ADR 0003) — the first such field, and the precedent should not be extended casually. It is
  safe only because `validate.ts` re-derives it from `exits`; keep that check if the field
  changes. Two traps: it means **declared, not reachable** (a shut door and a false condition are
  in the list — it is not a pathfinding graph), and it assumes the **exit graph is static**,
  which holds for Zork I but would fail *silently* for a game that opens a passage at runtime.
  That game forces the general reflection op ADR 0003 rejected on cost.
- **The exit-scan rewrite is the extractor's one non-mechanical transform.** It is fail-closed
  and tested by perturbation, but it is a pattern match against one ZIL idiom: an unrelated
  routine written in a *similar* shape would not match (correct), and a future edit that loosens
  the match to catch more cases is how it would start producing wrong loops. Loosen it only with
  a test that pins what it must still refuse.
- **`state.parser` is deliberately outside the save contract.** Orphan questions and the "it"
  referent are mid-sentence scratch, not world state; `restore` clears them rather than
  reinstating a half-asked question.
- **Pronoun with no referent diverges in one case.** In West of House, where the mailbox is the
  room's only object, the reference resolves "READ IT" *to the mailbox* rather than refusing.
  Whether that is a one-candidate fallback is unverified, so we refuse in both rooms — matching
  the many-object case only. Recorded at the call site in `engine/src/engine.ts`.
- **Multi-object lists are unimplemented** beyond `ALL`. "TAKE LEAFLET AND MAILBOX" is correctly
  kept as *one* turn by the sentence splitter, but the second noun is dropped; the reference
  prints a prefixed answer per object, as `TAKE ALL` already does.
- **`room-title` channel is unused in practice — resolved at 5.2, no contract change.** The engine
  delegates room description to Zork's own `DESCRIBE-ROOM`, which prints the name with
  `<TELL D ,HERE>`, so the title cannot be split onto its own channel without parsing prose —
  which ADR 0002 forbids. **The channel stays** (the console status line is its consumer,
  `docs/panel-grammar-discussion.md` §7.1), and the documented workaround is now implemented and
  tested: `web/src/status.ts` resolves the room name from the world document by id, taking it from
  `player-moved`.to and — for the opening turn, which emits none — from the player's own
  `object-moved`. An unknown id renders as the id, so a gap is visible rather than blank.
  **Two adjacent findings from the same stage**, both consumer-side, both tested, neither needing a
  contract change: `start()` emits no `player-moved`, and `restore()` emits no events at all
  (derived UI state must be rebuilt from `SaveState`).
- **`game-over` may double-emit — unverified.** The §10 event census counts **22 `game-over`
  events across 11 walkthroughs**, two per walkthrough within the same turn. Possibly legitimate
  (a death followed by a quit), possibly a double-emit. Harmless to per-turn logic and to the
  parity harness, which compares text; it would matter to a UI that reacts to the event. Noticed
  incidentally, not investigated.
- **Stubbed builtins**: `V-CLIMB-UP` alone now (GETPT), returning a no-op so call sites reach a
  defined value instead of crashing a turn. `RANDOMIZE-OBJECTS` and `HERO-BLOW` are real
  extracted routines as of v0.7.0.
- **Extracting a routine can silently *shadow* an engine builtin**, because routines take
  precedence in `callRoutine`. `LIT?` did exactly that in v0.8.0 and cost every dark-room turn
  until it was excluded by `ENGINE_IMPLEMENTED`. `DO-WALK` and `THIS-IS-IT` are currently both
  extracted *and* builtins and happen to agree — **check this whenever the extraction frontier
  moves**; the failure is total and silent, and the catalog will not mention it.
- **`GO` runs at engine construction**, not in `start()`, so initialization cannot be skipped.
  An explicit `start:` option overrides `GO`'s room placement and re-describes; `start()` just
  replays the events construction produced.
- **Randomized turns are verified by membership, not text parity** — the settled answer to the
  RNG question. `engine/test/combat.test.ts` derives the legal message set from the IR; it must
  stay derived, since a hand-listed set drifts and starts passing by construction. The thief
  follows the same pattern as of v0.8.2, through the shared `engine/test/membership.ts`.
  **Membership is one-sided and cannot be the whole check**: a *narrower* legal set never makes a
  passing line fail, so a broken derivation looks green. **Both suites now carry the two things
  that close this** (v0.8.3) — world-state assertions for the behaviour, and a positive control
  of real reference output. Any *new* membership suite needs both from the start; membership
  alone is not evidence of anything but legality.

**Project / M5**
- **Backdrops ✅ decided — three for the MVP, AI-generated ones considered after.** They are
  **not** the binding constraint on 5.4 after all: the opening area is 12 outdoor rooms plus the
  house interiors, and the three shipped backdrops cover it. The scarcity gates **5.5**
  (full-game), not 5.4. `web/src/comic/backdrop.ts` now assigns rooms by table, not regex.
  **The live risk is `room8bs.bmp`'s content, not the count.** It is a *conservatory* — glass
  dome, planter, topiary — which is honest for Kitchen and will read badly as Cellar, Maze or
  Temple, where ~89 of the 110 rooms live. That is what the post-MVP art has to fix, and it is
  the reason "one generic interior" is not a durable answer.
- **`web/assets/comic/` is a committed build artifact.** Regenerate with `npm --prefix art run
  pack`; the cast is pinned in that script, so a recast is a one-line change plus a re-pack.
  **Re-pack after any `art/` decode change** — v1.4.1 fixed the decoder and the committed sheets
  stayed inverted until they were regenerated, so the source fix alone did not fix the site.
- **`art/` has no assertion that any rendered image *looks* like anything, apart from
  `test/polarity.test.ts`.** The corpus sweep checks coverage and bounds, both of which an
  inverted, mis-hued or mirrored figure satisfies. This was a released defect at v1.4.0, found
  by a human looking at the page. **Two consequences for 5.4:** any new colour/polarity decision
  needs its own pinned assertion, and *looking at the output* stays part of the loop — the
  regression that reached the browser was invisible to 13 passing tests.
- **Running `npx vitest` from the repo root times out `art/test/corpus.test.ts`.** The corpus
  sweep takes ~11 s and its longer timeout lives in `art/vitest.config.ts`, which a root-level
  run does not pick up. Not a regression and not new; use `npm --prefix <pkg> test`.
- Neutral branding for commercial assets (engine/IR/importer).
- Repo is prepared for public release but not yet public; nothing blocks it.
- **Backdrop scarcity ✅ decided (MVP: ship the three).** 3 shipped Comic Chat backdrops vs. 110
  Zork rooms, no `AT_BACKDROP` assets. **Ship the three for the MVP; revisit with AI-generated
  backdrops afterwards.** The options sketched earlier — compositions that avoid backdrops,
  deriving variants from the three originals, new art in the Woodring hatch idiom for the ~10
  rooms that carry the game — stay on the table for that pass. Whatever generates them **must
  match the Woodring hatch idiom and the 1-bit polarity the decoder now produces**, and per the
  `art/` item above it needs a pinned assertion of its own: nothing in the suite would notice a
  backdrop that is merely plausible.
- **Sprite-sheet packing ✅ decided at 5.3** — one sheet per avatar, **parts not figures**, figure
  and aura as paired sub-rects. `art/tools/avbdump.ts` remains the *inspection* tool;
  `art/tools/avbpack.ts` is the build. Rationale is on `art/src/cast-manifest.ts`.
- **`art/src/pose.ts` diverges from the original on purpose, once.**
  `CAvatarComplex::GetBodyFromEmotion` reuses one `nearestI` across its face and torso loops, so
  a request whose torso search matches nothing draws *the face's index as a torso*. The port
  falls back to neutral instead, matching what the `CEmotionOpts` path already does. Recorded at
  the call site.
- `README.md:27` still says the engine is "inspired by the original gameplay" — understates the
  commitment to behavioral compatibility verified by golden transcripts. Minor wording.

---

## Standing Notes

Hard-won rules that outlive any one session.

- **P-WON gating is settled: do not implement it.** The transcripts contradict the source
  (v0.6.5); the reasoning is at the call site, because the source reads the other way and the
  next reader will otherwise "fix" it back.
- **The shipped Release 119 story file is ground truth**, not the ZILF-reconstructed source in
  `original-projects/` (settled in stage 0.2). Where the two disagree, the transcript wins.
- **Ask the reference build rather than reasoning about the ZIL.** Nearly every parser and
  `TAKE ALL` detail in 4.5/4.6 was settled that way, and several confident readings of the
  source turned out wrong. `dfrotz -w 80 -s 1234 -p <story file>`.
- **"Cannot verify" and "fails to verify" are different states**, and the harness says which.
  Whole-file `# parity: informational` marks a limit of the method; per-turn
  `# informational: <reason>` … `# strict:` quarantines a passage inside an otherwise strict
  walkthrough. Quarantined turns leave the strict count in *both* numerator and denominator, and
  every opt-out must carry a written reason — both enforced by test.
- **A cascade has one cause.** A single missing routine or unreachable room turns into a dozen
  failing turns and buries where divergence actually began; find the first diverging turn before
  reading any later one.
- **`setFlag`/`move` on an unknown id silently invent a phantom entity**, which can make a test
  pass against an object that does not exist. Check ids against the world document.
